# Market Research Analysis for Energy Drinks Conducted by CodeX German Beverage Company
# Situation
CodeX, a German beverage company, launched its energy drink in 10 Indian cities to establish a foothold in the competitive market. To gauge the effectiveness of their marketing efforts and gather consumer insights, the Marketing team conducted a survey with 10,000 respondents. Tasked with deriving actionable insights from this data which I collected from codebasics.io website where the challenge was conducted, I, as a marketing data analyst, embarked on a comprehensive data analysis project. My goal was to analyze brand awareness, market share, and product development opportunities, providing the marketing team with strategic recommendations to enhance their market penetration and product appeal.
# Task
My task was to convert the survey results from 10,000 respondents across 10 Indian cities into meaningful insights for CodeX's marketing team. This involved cleaning and preparing the data, performing exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and patterns, and generating insights on brand awareness, market share, and product preferences. Additionally, I needed to develop targeted recommendations for marketing strategies and product development to help CodeX improve its market presence and appeal to consumers. This included creating visualizations and a detailed report to present my findings and strategic suggestions to the marketing team.
# Action
Using Power BI, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the survey data to uncover critical insights. I began by importing and cleaning the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. I then created various interactive dashboards and visualizations to analyze demographic trends, regional differences, and key metrics such as brand recognition, purchase intent, and product satisfaction. Through segmentation analysis and sentiment analysis, I identified high-potential customer segments and gauged consumer sentiment. Finally, I compiled a comprehensive report and interactive dashboards to present my findings and actionable recommendations to CodeX's marketing team, providing them with the insights needed to refine their marketing strategies and enhance product development.The preview of the dashboard is available below.
